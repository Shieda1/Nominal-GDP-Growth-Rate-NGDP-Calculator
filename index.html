    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the NGDP<br> 
    What is the NGDP?<br>
    the nominal gdp growth rate is a measurement of the difference in GDP between two years and it is usually expressed as a percentage.<br>
    How to calculate NGDP?<br>
    To calculate NGDP you should use the following formula:<br>
    Nominal GDP growth rate (NGDP) = (current year's GDP - last year's GDP) / last years's GDP<br>
    example: a country's current year GDP is $12,700,000 and it's last year's GDP was $11,300,000,000, calculate the NGDP.<br>
    NGDP = (current year's GDP - last year's GDP) / last year's GDP<br>
    NGDP = ($12,700,000,000 - $11,300,000,000) / $11,300,000,000<br>
    NGDP = 12%<br>
    Why use NGDP?<br>
    NGDP is used as andicator of the general health of the economy because it gives information abouth the size of the economy and how it is performing. simply an increase in the real GDP is a sign that the economy is generally healthy.<br>
